	<h1>Posterior Distribution</h1>
	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>In Bayesian statistics, the posterior probability of a random event or an uncertain proposition is the conditional probability that is assigned after the relevant evidence or background is taken into account. Similarly, the posterior probability distribution is the probability distribution of an unknown quantity, treated as a random variable, conditional on the evidence obtained from an experiment or survey. "Posterior", in this context, means after taking into account the relevant evidence related to the particular case being examined.</p>
	<h2>R Code</h2>
	<p>To find the posterior distribution of a data set using R we use the 
	function poisgamp(x,y,z).</p>
	
	<p>In a group of students, there are 2 out of 18 that are left-handed. Find the posterior distribution of left-handed students in the population assuming uninformative prior. Summarize the results. According to the literature 5-20% of people are left-handed. Take this information into account in your prior and calculate new posterior.</p>
