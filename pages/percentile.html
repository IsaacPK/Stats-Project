	<h1>Percentile</h1>
	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>A percentile is a data value that is found above a percentage
	of the remaining values in a data set. A value's percentile is calculated
	by determining the count of data values below the given value, and dividing
	the outcome by the total count of data values.</p>
	<h2>R Code</h2>
	<p>To find the percentile of a data set using R we use the 
	function quantile(). There are several other functions that can also
	be used. To learn about them type help(quantile) in R.</p>
	<code>&gt quantile(classheights, c(.19,.29))</code>
	<p>In this example, classheights is the name of
	a set of values representing all of the heights of
	students in Stat 151.This should be replaced with the
	data set for which you would like to find the percentile value.</p>
	<p>Additionally, c(.19,.29) represents the percentiles for which we would like 
	to find the value. In this example R will tell us the values for the
	19th and the 29th percentiles.</p>
