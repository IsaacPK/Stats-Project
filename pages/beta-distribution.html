	<h1>Beta Distribution</h1>
	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>In probability theory and statistics, the beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0, 1] parametrized by two positive shape parameters, denoted by alpha and beta, that appear as exponents of the random variable and control the shape of the distribution.

</p>
	<h2>R Code</h2>
	<p>You can use the qqnorm( ) function to create a Quantile-Quantile plot evaluating the fit of sample data to the normal distribution. More generally, the qqplot( ) function creates a Quantile-Quantile plot for any theoretical distribution.</p>

	<p>For example, pnorm(0) =0.5 (the area under the standard normal curve to the left of zero). qnorm(0.9) = 1.28 (1.28 is the 90th percentile of the standard normal distribution). rnorm(100) generates 100 random deviates from a standard normal distribution.</p>
