	<h1>Standard Deviation</h1>
	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>Standard Deviation is a numerical representation of how data values
	are spread in reference to the mean of the data values. It is
	the square root of the variance of a data set.</p>
	<h2>R Code</h2>
	<p>To find the standard deviation of a data set using R we use the 
	function sd().</p>
	<code>&gt sd(classheights)</code>
	<p>In this example, classheights is the name of
	a set of values representing all of the heights of
	students in Stat 151.This should be replaced with the
	data set for which you would like to find the standard deviation.</p>
