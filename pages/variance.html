	<h1>Variance</h1>
	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<p>Variance is a numerical representation of how data values
	are spread in reference to the mean of the data values. It is
	the average of the squared differences from the mean.</p>
	<h2>R Code</h2>
	<p>To find the variance of a data set using R we use the 
	function var().</p>
	<code>&gt var(classheights)</code>
	<p>In this example, classheights is the name of
	a set of values representing all of the heights of
	students in Stat 151.This should be replaced with the
	data set for which you would like to find the variance.</p>
